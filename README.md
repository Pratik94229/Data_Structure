## Getting Started

To use the implementations in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Pratik94229/Data_Structures.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

   ```
   cd Data_Structures
   ```

3. Choose a data structure of your choice and explore its implementation in the corresponding Python file. Each file contains the implementation as well as usage examples.

4. Run the tests to verify the functionality of the data structures.
